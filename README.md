## 🚀 Why I Build with AI

I'm passionate about **artificial intelligence** — not just as a technology, but as a tool to solve real problems for Cambodia and beyond. Every project I build teaches me something new, and I'm constantly learning, iterating, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning.

From **Khmer handwriting recognition** to **AI-powered recruitment systems**, I love exploring how AI can make technology more accessible and impactful in low-resource settings. My drive comes from curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and the belief that AI should serve people — especially those whose languages and needs are often overlooked.

I don't just build models — I ship **production-ready AI systems** with:

✅ **MLOps rigor**: Dockerized environments, async processing, comprehensive logging  
✅ **Low-resource optimization**: 96% accuracy on Khmer digit recognition with efficient architectures (LSTM/GRU)  
✅ **Vector search expertise**: pgvector + OpenAI embeddings for semantic retrieval (10× faster queries)  
✅ **Full-stack ownership**: From data collection (Streamlit UIs) → model training → FastAPI deployment  

> *"Building AI systems for Cambodia, by Cambodia — one model at a time."*
